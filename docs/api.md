# Vantiq SDK for Python

This package contains the Vantiq  SDK for the Python language.

The SDK consists of the following classes

* `Vantiq` -- this is a class handling the client's interaction with the Vantiq system
* `VantiqError` -- structured errors returned from Vantiq
* `VantiqException` -- Exception raised from Vantiq when necessary
* `VantiqResponse` -- Structured resposne from Vantiq operations
* `VantiqResources` -- Names for Vantiq resources that may be used in for Vantiq operations

The Vantiq SDK is built atop the asyncio-based aiohttp. Consequently, operations marked as async must be awaited.
See [the Python asyncio documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) for more details.
The [Coroutines and Tasks documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html) has examples of
_asyncio_ Python programs.

Note that some Windows environments may require the setting of the _event loop policy_.
Please see [asyncio policy documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-policy.html) for details.

## VantiqResources

Defines the set of Vantiq Resources

More details about these resources can be found in the
[Vantiq Resource Reference Guide](https://dev.vantiq.com/docs/system/resourceguide/index.html).

The following constants are defined for these Vantiq system resources.

* ANALYTICS_MODELS
* AUDITS 
* CATALOGS 
* COLLABORATIONS
* COLLABORATION_TYPES
* DOCUMENTS
* IMAGES
* K8S_CLUSTERS

## VantiqError

Contains an error from the Vantiq system.


A VantiqError contains three (3) properties:

* _code_ : str -- The short string identifying the error
* _message_ : str -- The message template for the errors
* _params_ : list -- The parameters for the message template.

Message templates look and behave like strings for which the Python format() can supply values.
_E.g._,

```python
VantiqError("io.vantiq.python.short.code",
             "This is an error parameterized by an argument: {0}",
             ["an argument"])
```

<a name="VantiqException"></a>
## VantiqException(RuntimeError)
Contains an exception from the Vantiq system.

A VantiqException is a RuntimeError and contains three (3) properties:

* _code_ : str -- The short string identifying the error
* _message_ : str -- The message template for the errors
* _params_ : list -- The parameters for the message template.

Message templates look and behave like strings for which the Python format() can supply values.

## VantiqResponse

A response from a Vantiq operation

A Vantiq response contains information returned from a Vantiq operation. This information is represented by the following properties:

* _is_success_ : bool -- Did the operation succeed
* _content_type_ : str -- The content type of the message returned.  Usually 'application/json'.
* _count_ : int -- Where applicable, the number of items returned for a successful operation.  This is generally available after a count() or delete() operation.
* _errors_ : list -- A list of VantiqError entries outlining a failed operation
* _body_ : list | dict | StreamReader -- The results of the operation.


## Vantiq
The interface for working with the Vantiq System.

This class consists of operations that can be performed using the Vantiq system. More information about these operations can be found in the 
[Vantiq Resource Reference Guide](https://dev.vantiq.com/docs/system/resourceguide/index.html)
and the [Vantiq API Reference Guide](https://dev.vantiq.com/docs/system/api/index.html) .

Logging for this class can be configured using a `logging.ini` file that is present in the working directory of the running program.

The Vantiq object instance can be used as a context manager.

```python
async with Vantiq(<server url>) as client:
    resp: VantiqResponse = client.select(VantiqResource, ...)
```

As noted, most of the operations in the Vantiq object are `async` and must be awaited for them to run. See [the Python Asyncio documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)
for more details about working with async operations.

### Vantiq Object

Create a Vantiq client object.

* _api_version_ : str (optional) -- Version of the API to uwe. Defaults to '1'

#### Returns

The Vantiq object can be used as a context manager.

#### Examples

Context manager

#### Returns:

`VantiqResponse`


### Vantiq.start\_subscriber\_transport() (async) 

Start a task to handle subscriptions.

To handle incoming messages from the Vantiq server that arise from subscriptions, you must start an
asyncio task to do this work.  This method does that work.

If the transport does not exist when subscribe() is called, subscribe() will start
the transport on your behalf.

#### Parameters

(none)

#### Returns
The task created. Can be used to wait or manage that task.

If the subscriber connection already exists, None is returned as there is no new task.
    

### Vantiq.subscribe() (async)

Subscribe to an event from the Vantiq server, specifically to a specific topic, source, or type event.

For sources, this will subscribe to message arrival events.  The name of the
source is required (_e.g._, `MySource`).

For topics, this will subscribe to any messages published on that topic.  The
name of the topic is required (_e.g._, `/some/topic`).

For services, this will subscribe to any messages published to the named service event. The name of the
service and service event is required, and should be passed into the resource id as service_name/event_name.

For types, this will subscribe to the specified type event.  The name of the
type and the operation (_i.e._, `insert`, `update`, or `delete`) are required.

#### Parameters
 
* _resource_ : str -- The resource type for which this subscription is being made
* _resource_id_ : str -- The identifier of the specific instance of the `resource` in question.
* _operation_ : str -- The operation to which to subscribe when subscribing to a VantiqResources.TYPES event. Should be `None` for other resource types.
* _callback_ : Callable[[str, dict], Awaitable[None]] -- A callback function to call when a subscribed event arrives. The callback will be called with the
type of the callback (`connect`, `message`, `error`) and the message contents.
<br><br>
The callback message contains the following properties:

    * _status_ : int -- the status of the event
    * _contentType_ : str -- the content type of the message
    * _path_ : str -- the event specification
    * _value_ : dict -- the value of the event (type inserted, topic contents, etc.)
    
* _params_ : dict -- (optional) Parameters for the subscription. May be subscription dependent,
but can usually be ignored.


#### Returns

`VantiqResponse`

For details, see the [API Reference Guide](https://dev.vantiq.com/docs/system/api/index.html).

### Vantiq.ack() (async)

Acknowledge the receipt of a reliable message from reliable resources after creating a persistent subscription.

#### Parameters 

* _request_id_ : str -- id of the request. This can be found in the 'X-Request_id' header of the callback for the subscription
* _subscription_id_ : str -- id of the subscription that delivered the message. This is found in the `[body][name]` field of the callback for the subscription message.
* _msg_ : dict -- message being acknowledged.  This should be the `[body]` field of the message (`value` field) delivered to the subscription callback.
        
#### Raises:

`VantiqException`

### Vantiq.register_subscriber\_on\_close()

Register a callback to be called when the subscriber is closed. Useful for the subscriber to know that there's no
longer any subscriber active (for whatever reason).  This could happen due to issues at the server side or with the
connection between the client & server.

#### Parameters:
* _callback_ : Callable[[], Awaitable[None]]
        The callback to be called when the subscriber is closed. This call can be made at most once per subscriber.
